  <p>HEAD IN THE CLOUDS is an interative sound and light wearable that is meant to be wear on the viewer's head. The light and the sound change depending on the viewer's head movement.</p>

  <p><b> - Think of a context and an environment where you would like to intervene. Where will you present your project? Who is it made for?
    </b></p>
  <p>I would like to present my project in a quiet dark room, since it has to do with lighting and the interaction between lights and sounds. The environment needs be tranquil enough that the player’s voice wouldn’t be corrupted by any noise. I would
    like the rooms to be spacious, since I imaged that my installation would take a decent amount of space. But I am not certain about the exact size of my installation yet. The installation is made for people who love surrealist stories and
    fantasies. And it is also for people who love interactive installations with lights and sounds. I also might incorporate poems into the project.
  </p><br>
  <p><b> - Think about the kind of relationship you wish to foster among and between users and the artifact or installation. What will your project afford users and how would the experience make them reflect on themselves, their environment, society
      and your intentions?
  </p></b>
  <p> I want the viewers to not only see and experience the project but become a part of the project. The viewers are not only observing the installation from a distance, but they have a chance to be completely inside the project. I intend for “Head
    in the Clouds” to be an immersive experience that makes people reflect on our perspective and the idea of being “inside” and “outside”. I would like to limit the physical space around the viewer (putting the box/house over their head), and let
    the viewer focus only on what is happening around them in proximity. I want to express this idea of “hyper focus” and being “the outsider”. In a way, this is my intention to show others how an introvert feels on the daily basis.
  </p><br>
  <p><b> - Think about the notion of empowerment. Is your artifact really helping or challenging users or is it just another psychological prosthesis?
  </p></b>
  <p>I would like to focus on the idea of “headspace” and challenge the viewers to reflect on their own headspace. I intend for the viewers to enter a hyper focus space, and the discomfort of being in a tight space surrounded with unusual
    sounds/lights will challenge them. I am not sure whether my installation will give the viewer’s the notion of empowerment. On the contrary, I feel like my project will take a certain amount of power away from them.
  </p><br>
  <p><b> - Think about how to successfully communicate your intentions - what Interaction Design Strategies will you employ? What are you trying to tell us?
  </p></b>
  <p>I intend to employ physical objects/space, visual representations and behaviour. I will use physical objects/space, like the house and the window, as frames to limit the physical space, so that the viewers can focus on the installation alone. I
    will also use physical objects/space to separate “inside” and “outside” of the project. The viewer’s body also becomes a part of the physical space. For visual representations, the users can manipulate the LED lights with their head movement. The
    lights will change color depending on how fast the user is moving. As for behaviours, the viewer’s actions are directly linked to the behaviours of the lights/ sounds.
  </p><br>
  <p><b> - A Non-Technical Evaluation of Sensors and their associated affordances which would ideally support your project's proposed Interaction Design strategy.
  </p></b>
  <p>I will use physical materials, such as cardboard and wood planks to build the house and the window. And I will use soft materials like cottons and tissue to build the clouds in the bottom. For the lights, I will use LED light strips and align
    them on the inside of the house. I will also need a micro controller to manipulate the lights, including the color and the brightness. And since I intend for the light to change depending on the user’s movement, I will likely need a motion
    detector. For the sounds, I will need to attach a speak to the body of the house, I also might incorporate poems into the project. </p>
  <br>
  <p><b> - Research three similar projects and provide a summary
  </p></b>
  <p><a href="https://heyhush.com/work/hush-lenses-interactive-art-installation/ "><span class="bold">LENSES</span></a> is made by New York creative agency Hush. It is a sound and light installation, where the user can influence the sounds by bending
    the objects, changing the colors and angles of the light, which in turn triggers sound changes. The installation is meant to be observed an)d manipulated with on a wall. As the user plays with the transparent prisms, the light reflected by the
    different surfaces of the prisms are converted into sound. By experimenting with different combinations, users build a colorful visual array that is also translated into real-time sound effects. The studio explains that “the process of developing
    Lenses is reflective of the way we approach every project, big or small, pushing the boundaries of the physical-digital design process”.
  </p>
  <p><a href="https://timmb.com/post-truth-and-beauty/ "><span class="bold">POST TRUTH AND BEAUTY</span></a> is made by Tim Murray-Browne, an artist and creative coder from the UK creating interactive installations and performances. His work has been
    exhibited around the world at venues including Tate Modern, The Victoria & Albert Museum and Berkeley Art Museum. “Post-Truth and Beauty aims to create a sensory experience analogous to the ungraspable nature of ‘truth’ by presenting partial
    glimpses into an abstract world of light and sound”. The installation tracks the position of the viewer’s head and combines it with the 3D speaker ring to create the illusion that each sound is floating in a fixed position. The viewer is immerged
    in to a slowly evolving textured soundscape. The installation uses camera-based head-tracking, Ambisonics 3D audio and bespoke software. The difference between physical materials and computer generated illusion challenges the viewer’s sense of
    truth and personal perspective.
  </p>
  <p><a href="https://www.uwindsor.ca/visualarts_nmpl/388/nbf17-light-poems-la-voix-des-anciens "><span class="bold">LIGHT POEMS</span></a> is a public nighttime poetry projection made by Jenny Holzer. She has been making light projection
    installations since 1991. Holzer’s installations often speak about love, death, sex, war or forgiveness. Her projects make the viewers experience the touch of light against the surface of public places. She intends an imaginative experience for
    the viewers, and a collective experience as the viewers all read the poems together.
  </p><br>
  <p><b> - Write a paragraph on how/why your project will be different and impactful in comparison to the projects you researched.
    </b></p>
  <p> I realize that many light and sound installations offer a public, collective experience. I want to offer a personal experience, something that the viewers can immerse themselves in without worrying about others. I would like my project to give
    the viewers a new sense of space and reflect on the idea of being “inside” and “outside” of a space, not only physically but also mentally. I want to convey the experience of being an “outsider” and someone who is in their own headspace all the
    time. I believe that my project will be different in comparison to the projects I have researched because mine is much more personal.
