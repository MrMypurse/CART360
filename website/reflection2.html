      <p>Sprayable User Interfaces: Prototyping Large-Scale Interactive Surfaces with Sensors and Displays presents the technology of sprayable user interface, which allows the users to create large-scale interactive surfaces on various surfaces. The paper focuses on how to implement the spraying technique and the results of many tests on different types of surface textures. The method requires an airbrush system and a set of stencils. In the case of this study, we are creating an interactive pattern of a spraying can. The stencils are designed with Blender and is acted as the first layer on the surface. The second layer is sprayed on with ink loaded in the airbrush. The ink is then left to dry for twenty minutes. The user can add stencils and layers by repeating the same progress. More interestingly, user can select from drawing tools that act as input elements: touch buttons, sliders, proximity sensors. output elements, electroluminescent displays. There are also output elements: electroluminescent displays, connector elements, wires, the microcontroller connecter pattern, and an erase tool. The study also gives various other examples of applications in public and private spaces. The interactive sofa contains a touch sensor that can detect if the user sits on the sofa, which triggers the photo album starting to play on the TV screen. The ambient music interface is a good example of implementing spraying system to create architecture projects with interactive elements. The note that corresponds to the viewer’s movement will start playing as the viewers touches the design consisting of music notes on the wall. Overall, the Sprayable User Interfaces seem to be a great tool to create large scale interactive surfaces.

    I think that systems like Sprayable User Interfaces will be a great asset in our public spaces, especially assisting people with visual impairment. “Small Cities” from the study is a good example to using touch displays to offer more accessible service. Instead of only using the curved displays to give tourists audible information about sightseeing spots, we can use the Sprayable User Interfaces with different textured surfaces. When a person with visual impairment touches the surface, they will be able to identify the sightseeing spots (maybe using Braille) and receive the information they need in audio. It can also help people with other disabilities, to cross the street, for example. Instead of having a bottom, a sprayable interfaces allow people in a wheelchair to touch any part of the surface.
